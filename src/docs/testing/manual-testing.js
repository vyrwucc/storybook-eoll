    Now we arrive at the most interesting (but also hardest) part of UI testing. We usually do this as a team.

    First, we need to make a pretty solid Storybook or a set of Storybooks covering most of the scenarios of our UI components. For that we can follow the following structure:

    * Write stories for your individual UI components.
    * Write another set of stories for integrating the above UI components (you could consider your pages).

    For the individual UI components, you may be using a different repository. Then, keep a storybook inside it for those components. Then, in the main app, write stories for integrations.

    ## Testing Plan
    Open a new PR (or multiple of them). Then run your Storybook and start reviewing one story at a time. Then you can comment on the PR.

    > To get a better result, you can use **Storybook Hub**, where you can comment inside individual stories and share your storybook with non-developers. <br/>
    > We will be releasing it in the first week of October.
    > Join our [Newsletter](http://tinyletter.com/storybooks) or [Slack Team](https://storybooks-slackin.herokuapp.com/) to get updates.
